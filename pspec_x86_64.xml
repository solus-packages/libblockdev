        <Summary xml:lang="en">A library for manipulating block devices</Summary>
        <Description xml:lang="en">The libblockdev is a C library with GObject introspection support that can be
used for doing low-level operations with block devices like setting up LVM,
BTRFS, LUKS or MD RAID. The library uses plugins (LVM, BTRFS,...) and serves as
a thin wrapper around its plugins&apos; functionality. All the plugins, however, can
be used as standalone libraries. One of the core principles of libblockdev is
that it is stateless from the storage configuration&apos;s perspective (e.g. it has
no information about VGs when creating an LV).
